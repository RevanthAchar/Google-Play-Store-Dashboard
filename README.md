# Introduction

Business Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to analyze the Google Play Store Apps dataset to derive insights into the app market. We aim to understand the factors that contribute to an app's success, including user ratings, reviews, and category. Exploring user sentiments towards apps through the analysis of user reviews dataset will provide insights into the popularity of app categories based on total installs and the sentiment polarity of user reviews. The ultimate objective is to offer recommendations for app developers to enhance their app's performance and user satisfaction.
